# What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed by Anthropic, is an open standard designed to enable large language models (LLMs) to interact seamlessly with external tools and data sources. By standardizing these interactions, MCP allows AI systems to perform tasks like reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts across various platforms. In the context of GitHub Copilot, MCP enhances the agent mode in Visual Studio Code, enabling the AI to access tools such as GitHub repositories, databases, and web services directly. This integration allows developers to execute complex tasks‚Äîlike updating a GitHub profile based on recent pull requests‚Äîthrough natural language prompts, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.
